The brainchild of [Susie O'Brien](https://github.com/susancal), [Laura Rumage](https://github.com/laurarumage), and [William Jung](https://github.com/william-jung). A fun, one-day project created in Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp.

Hydrake Yourself is an app that helps users track their daily water intake, inspired by Drake and the music video for his 2015 hit Hotline Bling.

Feel free to visit the website, register an account, and start drinking some water! Be sure to turn up the volume as you click around.
